# CVA6 Cache based side channel attacks

This folder contains implementations of a prime and probe attack and an evict and reload attack on the [CVA6 core](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) developed by openhwgroup.

The code is based on the Prime and Probe attack by Valentin Martinoli, Elouan Tourneur, Yannick Teglia and RÃ©gis Leveugle https://github.com/CCALK-work/CCALK


`make all` builds linux binaries in the bin folder to run on the CVA6 that is configured onto the genesys 2 board.


Run `send.sh` to send the binaries to CVA6 after having set up the ssh connection.
